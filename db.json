      "name": "Imperial Cities of Morocco - 8 Days - Classic Escorted Tours",
      "info": "The very name Morocco conjures up an enduring fascination – geographically close to Europe but culturally, a world apart. Despite the many years of French and Spanish colonial rule, a sense of the past is always present. In Morocco, you are quite literally walking on history. As a backdrop, the country’s vast geography is also remarkable: from the Mediterranean coastline, through mountain ranges to the empty wilderness of the Sahara Desert. Roman ruins, Berber kasbahs, superb Islamic architecture and the foothills of the Atlas Mountains are all bathed in a unique shimmering light. You can choose to lose yourself in the narrow winding streets of the old medinas or join the locals amidst the clatter of a busy souk.  Fez, Meknes, Marrakesh and Rabat – these are the imperial cities of Morocco and all are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage sites. Dating back almost a thousand years, Marrakesh is where Europe, Africa and the Middle East mingle and merge. Perched on the edge of the Sahara Desert and framed by the Atlas Mountains, this ancient trading hub quite simply bursts with intoxicating energy.",

Quite remarkable! ",

      "info": "Rome was, is, and probably always will be, one of the world’s most compelling cities with probably more to see here than in any other capital on earth. Boasting an uninterrupted recorded history for upwards of 2,500 years, nowhere else seems to have managed to combine, and with such finesse, a heritage of classical antiquities, and medieval buildings from Renaissance palaces to intricate Baroque piazzas. From the grandeur of the Colosseum, scene of some of the most cruel acts ever committed, the Appian Way where Spartacus was crucified, the magnificence of St. Peter’s, the grandeur of the Vatican, the sheer brilliance of the Sistine Chapel, to the Trevi Fountain and flamboyant Baroque buildings – the list is endless. But Rome is much more than monuments, incredible though they are! Italy also boasts one of the world’s greatest cuisines. Far from being pizza and pasta, one of the first things that really strikes you about visiting a restaurant here, is how deeply embedded in the culture food and drink really is. ",
